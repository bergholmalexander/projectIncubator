# Week 1 Rundown  
Group agreement:  
- Start with 3 hrs per week, incrementally if/when less busy
- Make it using JS -> React, Java backend
- We will use Trelo to plan, rather than sprints

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)  
Contains the following pages:  
- Landing  
- LogIn / SignUp  
- Home Page  
- Profile Page  
- Groups Page  

The MVP has two functionalities:  
- Creating projects and displaying projects  
- Saying whether you are interested in a project (which will allow for the creator to pick you to be part of the project)  
MVP comments:  
- Seniors are verified for validity and allow for credibility to a project  
- Projects can exist without an owner  
  
Other comments (future implementation)  
Home Page  
* Agreed on 'Boss-timer'-esque map on NewsFeed
  * Timer for project proposal deadlines
  * "Health-bar" for projects that are on going
* Should have all the problems/projects under the map Reddit-style, with options for trending, etc ...
* Projects will be kind of like kickstarter but with seniors/juniors being the "money bar".
Seniors/Juniors say whether they're interested in working on the project and get picked out.  
* Should host not just projects huge projects but allow for an environment in which to have projects for climate change, beach cleaning events, charity events ... usable by schools
* Should be linkable like github
* Projects should have a timeline that is easy to advertise: Log of progress ...

# Week 1 Rundown  
Group agreement:  
- Start with 3 hrs per week, incrementally if/when less busy
- Make it using JS -> React, Java backend
- We will use Trelo to plan, rather than sprints

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)  
Contains the following pages:  
- Landing  
- LogIn / SignUp  
- Home Page  
- Profile Page  
- Groups Page  

The MVP has two functionalities:  
- Creating projects and displaying projects  
- Saying whether you are interested in a project (which will allow for the creator to pick you to be part of the project)  
MVP comments:  
- Seniors are verified for validity and allow for credibility to a project  
- Projects can exist without an owner  
  
Other comments (future implementation)  
Home Page  
* Agreed on 'Boss-timer'-esque map on NewsFeed
  * Timer for project proposal deadlines
  * "Health-bar" for projects that are on going
* Should have all the problems/projects under the map Reddit-style, with options for trending, etc ...
* Projects will be kind of like kickstarter but with seniors/juniors being the "money bar".
Seniors/Juniors say whether they're interested in working on the project and get picked out.  
* Should host not just projects huge projects but allow for an environment in which to have projects for climate change, beach cleaning events, charity events ... usable by schools
* Should be linkable like github
* Projects should have a timeline that is easy to advertise: Log of progress ...

# Week 3 Rundown
Talked about 3 specific User Stories:  
- A high school student wants to be part of a project, but doesn't have thier own idea. Through this website they are able to find a project to be part of in their vicinity.  
- An NGO/SME has a problem that they wish for people to bring project solution proposals for. Arts students are able to slightly tweak essays that they have written for class and try to apply them to a real life task.  
- A school wants an application in which they can monitor, handle and log students CAS projects and create events (fundraising, cleaning beaches...).  
The website will be more catered towards the first two.

Began implementing the Landing Page, using the following mock-up as a base: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Bnlmf1JwfeHeFd_Y8xLMAekwNZCLx-H/view?usp=sharing

### Concept  

#### What is our goal?  
We are developing a project incubator, which provides individuals with the ability to make change happen in the world -- Fight for the things they want to fight for, ranging from sustainability to human rights.  

#### Market Segment
While this project allows anyone to participate, it is initially aimed at two markets.  
*Seniors* Who have experience in fields such as Consulting, Engineering, Directing, Marketing, Critical thinking ... Seniors are people who are willing to spend X amount of hours a week working on a project they are passionate about, helping people of younger generations grow their experience while providing insight.  

*Juniors* (Mainly undergrad students) who have ambitions to make a difference in the world, either again in a field of interest or in a predefined project. They have knowledge from courses but want now want to apply this knowledge to develop experience and to make a difference.  

#### What are the issues present?
Seniors desire doing something 'more green', but may lack the opportunity to do so, want to do something specifically for a field of interest, or might not be able to do so beside working.  

The opportunities for good internships for juniors are limited, competitive, and often not directly in a field of interest. NGO's have restricted resources and cannot always provide additional resources to help. We're here to become the middle ground!

#### What is in it for 'seniors' and 'juniors'?
Seniors get to contribute in a project that improves work performed towards an area of interest. Seniors contribute their X hours and reach this goal of doing something green with minimal constraints or losses.  
Juniors get experience in thriving in projects in a field that they wish to pursue in the future. They get to put successful projects on their resume and learn how to develop projects from start to finish.

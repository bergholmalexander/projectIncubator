(Name is a work in progress)  

### Concept  

#### What is our goal?  
We are developing a project incubator, which provides individuals with the ability to make change happen in the world -- Fight for the things they want to fight for, ranging from sustainability to human rights.  

#### Market Segment
While this project allows anyone to participate, it is initially aimed at two markets.  
*Seniors* Who have experience in fields such as Consulting, Engineering, Directing, Marketing, Critical thinking ... Seniors are people who are willing to spend X amount of hours a week working on a project they are passionate about, helping people of younger generations grow their experience while providing insight.  

*Juniors* (Mainly undergrad students) who have ambitions to make a difference in the world, either again in a field of interest or in a predefined project. They have knowledge from courses but want now want to apply this knowledge to develop experience and to make a difference.  

#### What are the issues present?
Seniors desire doing something 'more green', but may lack the opportunity to do so, want to do something specifically for a field of interest, or might not be able to do so beside working.  

The opportunities for good internships for juniors are limited, competitive, and often not directly in a field of interest. NGO's have restricted resources and cannot always provide additional resources to help. We're here to become the middle ground!

#### What is in it for 'seniors' and 'juniors'?
Seniors get to contribute in a project that improves work performed towards an area of interest. Seniors contribute their X hours and reach this goal of doing something green with minimal constraints or losses.  
Juniors get experience in thriving in projects in a field that they wish to pursue in the future. They get to put successful projects on their resume and learn how to develop projects from start to finish.

### How does it work?
On the website, anyone can create a project of interest. Every Y amount of days new projects are released, filtering through ideas that people in a location have had. Each project has a timer for Z amount of days, during which users will write proposals of how to solve the task at hand. These are usually written like essays seen in undergraduate Arts, but may require further backing of what solution is being proposed to solve the task at hand (if your team was chosen, how would you tackle this problem in a given amount of time?). After Z days the project will be closed for viewing. If the project was made by a junior or senior (for now) voting will be done by users to select which project(s) are the most likely to succeed. If the project was made by an NGO or SME, it is their decision on how to address choosing projects (they may choose which they believe to be most likely to succeed). The users will now have M months to work on this project and bring it from an idea into reality.
